## How to Run Frontend and Backend

### Frontend
To start the frontend, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

### Backend
To start the backend, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Installation
To install and run PulseMD locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avyukthinna/pulseMD.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pulsemD
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### MongoDB Setup
PulseMD requires a MongoDB connection to store data. You'll need to set up your own MongoDB instance. If you're using **MongoDB Atlas** or a local instance, make sure you have the connection URL ready.

1. Create a `.env` file in the `root` directory (if it doesnâ€™t already exist).
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_url
   ```
   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_url` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

For example, if you're using MongoDB Atlas, your connection string will look like:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

3. After adding the connection string, proceed with running the backend as described above.
